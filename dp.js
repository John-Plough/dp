function price(age, time) {
  if (age <= 12) {
    return 5;
  } else if (age <= 59) {
    if (time < 6) {
      return 7;
    } else {
      return 10;
    }
  } else {
    return 7;
  }
}

// console.log(price(5, 5));
// console.log(price(5, 9));
// console.log(price(14, 5));
// console.log(price(14, 9));
// console.log(price(88, 5));
// console.log(price(88, 9));
